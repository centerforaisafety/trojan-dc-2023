<h2>Compute Credit Grants</h2>

<p>To enable broader participation in the competition, we are awarding $200 compute credit grants to student teams that demonstrate that they would not otherwise be able to participate. To apply, email the organizers at <a href="mailto:tdc-organizers@googlegroups.com">tdc-organizers@googlegroups.com</a> with the subject line "Compute Credit Grant Application". In the email, please include the following information.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Names and email addresses of your current team members. Team members are not required to have a .edu email address, but we expect this to be a student team (high school, undergraduate, graduate).</li>
  <li>The name of your school or educational institution.</li>
  <li>A few sentences describing how the compute credit grant would enable you to participate in the competition or make participation much easier. Possible reasons include lack of access to a GPU cluster or insufficient compute resources.</li>
</ul>
