<p><b>Update: Compute credit grants are no longer available.</b></p>

<p>To enable broader participation in the competition, we are awarding $500 compute credit grants to student teams that demonstrate that they would not otherwise be able to participate. To apply, email the organizers at <a href="mailto:tdc-organizers@googlegroups.com">tdc2023-organizers@googlegroups.com</a> with the subject line "Compute Credit Grant Application". In the email, please include the following information.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Names and email addresses of your current team members. Team members are not required to have a .edu email address, but we expect this to be a student team (high school, undergraduate, graduate).</li>
  <li>The name of your school or educational institution.</li>
  <li>A few sentences describing how the compute credit grant would enable you to participate in the competition or make participation much easier. Possible reasons include lack of access to a GPU cluster or insufficient compute resources.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Geographical Restrictions</h3>
<p>We will be unable to transfer money for compute credit grants into China, India, Russia, Somalia, Iran, Cuba, Sudan, Syria, or North Korea. This is either due to rules in the US limiting the transfer of money into these countries or rules in these countries making it difficult to transfer money into them from US nonprofits (notably, this is why India is on the list).</p>

<p><b>Important Details:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>If individuals with citizenship in these countries live and have bank accounts outside of these countries, then we can transfer money into those bank accounts.</li>
  <li>If a team consists of individuals living in the above countries and individuals living in other countries, then we will still be able to transfer money for compute credit grants to the team members who live and have bank accounts outside of the above countries.</li>
</ul>
