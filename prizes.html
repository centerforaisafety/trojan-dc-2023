<p>There is a $30,000 prize pool split across prizes and special awards. Monetary prizes will be awarded to the top three teams in the leaderboard for each track according to the values below. Final ordering in the leaderboard will be determined on the test phase data using the primary metric for each track, with secondary metrics used for tie-breaking as specified in the <a href="tracks.html">Tracks page</a>. Each team that wins the first-place prize in a track will also be invited to co-author a publication summarizing the competition results and will be invited to give a short talk at the competition workshop at NeurIPS 2023 (registration provided). Special awards will also be given for top submissions satisfying certain criteria.</p>

<h2>Eligibility</h2>
<p>To be eligible for prizes, winning teams are required to share their methods, code, and models with the organizers as well as the names and associations of each team member.</p>

<h3>Geographical Restrictions</h3>
<p>We will be unable to transfer prize money into China, India, Russia, Somalia, Iran, Cuba, Sudan, Syria, or North Korea. This is either due to rules in the US limiting the transfer of money into these countries or rules in these countries making it difficult to transfer money into them from US nonprofits (notably, this is why India is on the list).</p>

<p><b>Important Details:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Individuals living in the above countries are still allowed to participate in the competition and may receive non-monetary awards for winning submissions (co-authorship and an invitation to present at the workshop). We simply cannot transfer money into these countries.</li>
  <li>If individuals with citizenship in these countries live and have bank accounts outside of these countries, then we can transfer money into those bank accounts.</li>
  <li>If a team consists of individuals living in the above countries and individuals living in other countries, then we will still be able to transfer prize money to the team members who live and have bank accounts outside of the above countries. Team members may then distribute the prize money among themselves.</li>
</ul>

<!-- We cannot give awards to teams on US terrorist lists or those subject to sanctions. We are also unable to send money into Russia through any means, although participants in Russia are still welcome to participate and are eligible for non-monetary awards for winning submissions (co-authorship and an invitation to present at the workshop). -->
