<p>There is a $50,000 prize pool. Monetary prizes will be awarded to the top three teams in the leaderboard for each track according to the values below. Final ordering in the leaderboard will be determined on a held-out test set using the primary metric for each track, with secondary metrics used for tie-breaking as specified in the <a href="resources.html">Tracks page</a>. Each team that wins the first-place prize in a track will also be invited to co-author a publication summarizing the competition results and will be invited to give a short talk at the competition workshop at NeurIPS 2022 (registration provided). Special awards will also be given for top submissions satisfying certain criteria.</p>

<h2>Eligibility</h2>
<p>To be eligible for prizes, winning teams are required to share their methods, code, and models with the organizers as well as the names and associations of each team member. We cannot give awards to teams on US terrorist lists or those subject to sanctions. We are also unable to send money into Russia through any means, although participants in Russia are still welcome to participate and are eligible for non-monetary awards for winning submissions (co-authorship and an invitation to present at the workshop).</p>
