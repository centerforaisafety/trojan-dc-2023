<p>This is the upcoming website of the Trojan Detection Challenge (LLM Edition), a NeurIPS 2023 competition. The competition aims to advance the understanding and development of methods for detecting hidden functionality in large language models (LLMs). The competition features two main tracks: the Trojan Detection Track and the Red Teaming Track. In the Trojan Detection Track, participants will be given large language models containing thousands of trojans and tasked with discovering the triggers for these trojans. In the Red Teaming Track, participants will be challenged to elicit specific undesirable behaviors from a large language model fine-tuned to avoid those behaviors.</p>
